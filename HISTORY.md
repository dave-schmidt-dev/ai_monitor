# History

## 2026-03-13

- Added initial PTY-based terminal monitor for Codex and Claude usage.
- Mirrored the core local probing strategy used by `steipete/CodexBar`.
- Added parser tests and basic project documentation.
- Reworked the plain text output into a styled terminal dashboard with progress bars and reset countdowns.
- Added a `monitor` command entrypoint and repo-local launcher script.
- Tightened the dashboard layout with fixed compact card widths to preserve split view and avoid right-edge border wrapping.
- Standardized Claude and Codex dashboard wording around shared 5-hour and 1-week session windows, and removed the unused Codex credits row.
- Added GitHub-ready repo hygiene with a `.gitignore`, richer README documentation, and checked-in screenshots.
- Added an MIT license for public GitHub distribution.
